     demonstration of how the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) encoding scheme might be adopted to
     meet 90% of the needs of 90% of the TEI user community. In retrospect, it was predictable that
     many people should imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to TEI, or find TEI Lite to be far too
     heavy for their needs.</p><p>The original TEI Lite (1996) was based largely on observations of existing and previous
     practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as manifest in the collections of the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/">Oxford Text Archive</ref> and other collections of the period.
     It is therefore unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a <foreign xml:lang="la">de
      facto</foreign> standard, at least a common point of departure for electronic text centres and
     encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we actually produced this shortish, readable,
     manual for it also helped.</p><p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of <soCalled>Electronic Text Centers</soCalled>
     <!-- , many
     of whom produced their own documentation and
     tutorial materials (some examples are listed in
     <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials/"> the
     TEI Tutorials pages</ref>)-->
     and digital library initiatives. It was also adopted as the basis for some early TEI-conformant
     authoring systems, and as the basis for introductory tutorials, many of them in languages other
     than English (see further the list of legacy versions at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P4/Lite/"/>).</p><p>In 2002, following the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI Guidelines, which
     uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the TEI modification mechanism, the
     opportunity was taken to produce a lightly revised XML-conformant version. In 2006, a more
     substantially revised version based on TEI P5 was produced; this reflected the many changes
     between TEI P4 and TEI P5, but was not otherwise significantly different. In 2012, the TEI
     Technical Council, decided that a final revision should be undertaken to ensure that the
     documentation remained consistent with the latest (2.1) release of TEI P5. This version uses a
     recently added mechanism in the TEI customization architecture, which permits a customization
     to define only the TEI elements to be included in a schema, rather than the elements to be
     excluded from it. As such it is probably more resilient to change than earlier versions. </p><trailer>Lou Burnard, August 2012</trailer></div></front><body><p>This schema is created from TEI Lite for encoding and validating the EAD3 Tag Library file system.</p><div xml:id="U5-Intro"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed to anyone who wants to
     interchange information stored in an electronic form. They emphasize the interchange of textual
     information, but other forms of information such as images and sound are also addressed. The
     Guidelines are equally applicable in the creation of new resources and in the interchange of
     existing ones.</p><p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain features of a text in such a way as
     to aid the processing of that text by computer software running on different machines. This
     process of making explicit we call <term>markup</term> or <term>encoding</term>. Any textual
     representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI came into being partly because
     of the enormous variety of mutually incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting
     scholarship, and partly because of the expanding range of scholarly uses now being identified
     for texts in electronic form.</p><p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be expressed using a number of
     different formal languages. The first editions of the Guidelines used the <term>Standard
      Generalized Markup Language</term> (SGML); since 2002, this has been replaced by the use of
     the Extensible Markup Language (XML). These markup languages have in common the definition of
     text in terms of <term>elements</term> and <term>attributes</term>, and rules governing their
     appearance within a text. The TEI's use of XML is ambitious in its complexity and generality,
     but it is fundamentally no different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any
     general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process TEI-conformant texts.</p><p>Since 2001, the TEI has been a community initiative supported by an international membership
     consortium. It was originally an international research project sponsored by the Association
     for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the
     Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, with substantial funding over its first five
     years from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, Directorate General XIII of the
     Commission of the European Communities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Social Science and
     Humanities Research Council of Canada and others. The Guidelines were first published in May
     1994, after six years of development involving many hundreds of scholars from different
     academic disciplines worldwide. During the years that followed, the Guidelines became
     increasingly influential in the development of the digital library, in the language industries,
     and even in the development of the World Wide Web itself. The TEI Consortium was set up in
     January 2001, and a year later produced an edition of the Guidelines entirely revised for XML
     compatibility. In 2004, it set about a major revision of the Guidelines to take full advantage
     of new schema languages, the first release of which appeared in 2005. This revision of the TEI
     Lite document conforms to version 2.1 of this most recent edition of the Guidelines, TEI P5,
     released in June 2012.</p><p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI were defined by the closing statement
     of a planning conference held at Vassar College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these
      <soCalled>Poughkeepsie Principles</soCalled> were further elaborated in a series of design
     documents. The Guidelines, say these design documents, should: <list><item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for research;</item><item>be simple, clear, and concrete;</item><item>be easy for researchers to use without special-purpose software;</item><item>allow the rigorous definition and efficient processing of texts;</item><item>provide for user-defined extensions;</item><item>conform to existing and emergent standards.</item></list></p><p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines to have wide acceptability,
     it was important to ensure that: <list type="ordered"><item>the common core of textual features be easily shared;</item><item>additional specialist features be easy to add to (or remove from) a text;</item><item>multiple parallel encodings of the same feature should be possible;</item><item>the richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very small minimal
       requirement;</item><item>adequate documentation of the text and its encoding should be provided.</item></list></p><p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements and
     recommendations resulting from those design goals, which is called <title>TEI Lite</title>.</p><p>In selecting from the several hundred elements defined by the full TEI scheme, we have tried
     to identify a useful <soCalled>starter set</soCalled>, comprising the elements which almost
     every user should know about. Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable in
     understanding the full TEI scheme and in knowing how to integrate specialized parts of it into
     the general TEI framework.</p><p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows: <list type="simple"><item>it should be able to handle adequately a reasonably wide variety of texts, at the level
       of detail found in existing practice (as demonstrated in, for example, the holdings of the
       Oxford Text Archive);</item><item>it should be useful for the production of new documents (such as this one) as well as
       the encoding of existing texts;</item><item>it should be usable with a wide range of existing XML software;</item><item>it should be a pure subset of the full TEI scheme and defined using the customizaticon
       methods described in the TEI Guidelines;</item><item>it should be as small and simple as is consistent with the other goals.</item></list> The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or herself.</p><p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as suits a tutorial text, the
     reader should be aware that it does not cover every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of
     the elements described here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves, which should
     be consulted for authoritative reference information on these, and on the many others which are
     not described here. Some basic knowledge of XML is assumed.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-eg"><head>A Short Example</head><p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when a passage of prose is typed
     into a computer by someone with little sense of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of
     electronic texts. In an ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate optical
     scanner. It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the printed text, by retaining the
     original line breaks, by introducing blanks to represent the layout of the original headings
     and page breaks, and so forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard are needed (such
     as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long
     dash), it attempts to mimic their appearance.</p><p><eg xml:space="preserve">
                                CHAPTER 38

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                            474

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

      </eg></p><p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings: <list><item>the page numbers and running titles are intermingled with the text in a way which makes
       it difficult for software to disentangle them;</item><item>no distinction is made between single quotation marks and apostrophe, so it is difficult
       to know exactly which passages are in direct speech;</item><item>the preservation of the copy text's hyphenation means that simple-minded search programs

       only if the transcriber remembers to mention them in the documentation;</item><item>paragraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space, and hard carriage returns
       have been introduced at the end of each line. Consequently, if the size of type used to print
       the text changes, reformatting will be problematic.</item></list></p><p>We now present the same passage, as it might be encoded using the TEI Guidelines. As we shall
     see, there are many ways in which this encoding could be extended, but as a minimum, the TEI
     approach allows us to represent the following distinctions: <list><item>Paragraph and chapter divisions are now marked explicitly.</item><item>Apostrophes are distinguished from quotation marks; direct speech is explicitly
       marked.</item><item>The accented letter and the long dash are correctly represented.</item><item>Page divisions have been marked with an empty <gi>pb</gi> element alone.</item><item>The lineation of the original has not been retained and words broken by typographic
       accident at the end of a line have been re-assembled without comment.</item><item>For convenience of proof reading, a new line has been introduced at the start of each

     note that in the second example, end-of-line hyphenation has been silently removed. Conceivably
     Brontë (or her printer) intended the word <q>honeymoon</q> to appear as <q>honey-moon</q> on
     its second appearance, though this seems unlikely: our decision to focus on Brontë's text,
     rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition, makes it impossible to be
     certain. This is an instance of the fundamental <emph>selectivity</emph> of any encoding. An
     encoding makes explicit only those textual features of importance to the encoder. It is not
     difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short passage might readily be
     extended. For example: <list type="simple"><item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided; </item><item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;</item><item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</item><item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding text;</item><item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context could be
       prefixed to it;</item><item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc., could be
       provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category codes;</item><item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;</item><item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the encoding,
       with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and the analysis, or between
       the text and one or more translations of it;</item><item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other media.</item></list></p><p>TEI-recommended ways of carrying out most of these are described in the remainder of this
     document. The TEI scheme as a whole also provides for an enormous range of other possibilities,
     of which we cite only a few: <list type="simple"><item>detailed analysis of the components of names;</item><item>detailed meta-information providing thesaurus-style information about the text's origins
       or topics;</item><item>information about the printing history or manuscript variations exhibited by a
       particular series of versions of the text.</item></list> For recommendations on these and many other possibilities, the full Guidelines should
     be consulted.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-struc"><head>The Structure of a TEI Text</head><p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a <term>TEI header</term> (marked up as a

     optional <term>front</term> or <term>back</term>. In between is the <term>body</term> of the
     text, which, in the case of a composite text, may consist of <term>group</term>s, each
     containing more groups or texts.</p><p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader><text><front><!-- [ front matter ... ] --></front><body><!-- [ body of text ... ]  --></body><back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] --></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>A composite text also has an optional front and back. In between occur one or more groups of
     texts, each with its own optional front and back matter. A composite text will thus be encoded
     using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader><!--[ header information for the composite ]--></teiHeader><text><front><!--[ front matter for the composite  ]--></front><group><text><front><!--[ front matter of first text ]--></front><body><!--[ body of first text  ]--></body><back><!--[ back matter of first text ]--></back></text><text><front><!--[ front matter of second text]--></front><body><!--[ body of second text  ]--></body><back><!--[ back matter of second text ]--></back></text><!--[ more texts or groups of texts here ]--></group><back><!--[ back matter for the composite  ]--></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>It is also possible to define a composite of complete TEI texts, each with its own header.
     Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI corpus</term>, and may itself have a header: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiCorpus><teiHeader><!--[header information for the corpus]--></teiHeader><TEI><teiHeader><!--[header information for first text]--></teiHeader><text><!--[first text in corpus]--></text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader><!--[header information for second text]--></teiHeader><text><!--[second text in corpus]--></text></TEI></teiCorpus></egXML> It is also possible to create a composite of corpora -- that is,
     one <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element may contain many nested <gi>teiCorpus</gi> elements rather than
     many nested <gi>TEI</gi> elements, to any depth considered necessary.</p><p>In the remainder of this document, we discuss chiefly simple text structures. The discussion
     in each case consists of a short list of relevant TEI <term>elements</term> with a brief
     definition of each, followed by definitions for any <term>attributes</term> specific to that
     element, and a reference to any <term>classes</term> of which the element is a member. These
     references are linked to full specifications for each object, as given in the TEI
      <title>Guidelines</title>. In most cases, short examples are also given.</p><p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far: <specList><specDesc key="TEI"/><specDesc key="teiHeader"/><specDesc key="text"/><specDesc key="teiCorpus"/></specList></p></div><div xml:id="U5-body"><head>Encoding the Body</head><p>As indicated above, a simple TEI document at the textual level consists of the following
     elements: <specList><specDesc key="front"/><specDesc key="group"/><specDesc key="body"/><specDesc key="back"/></specList> Elements specific to front and back matter are described below in section <ptr target="#U5-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss the elements making up the body of a text. </p><div xml:id="divs"><head>Text Division Elements</head><p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or these paragraphs may be
      grouped together into chapters, sections, subsections, etc. Each paragraph is tagged using the
       <gi>p</gi> tag. The <gi>div</gi> element is used to represent any such grouping of
      paragraphs. <specList><specDesc key="p"/><specDesc key="div"/></specList>
     </p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>div</gi> element may be used to supply a
      conventional name for this category of text division, or otherwise distinguish them. Typical
      values might be <q>book</q>, <q>chapter</q>, <q>section</q>, <q>part</q>, <q>poem</q>,
       <q>song</q>, etc. For a given project, it will usually be advisable to define and adhere to a
      specific list of such values. </p><p>A <gi>div</gi> element may itself contain further, nested, <gi>div</gi>s, thus mimicking the
      traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as
      parts, containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in general conform to
      this simple hierarchic model.</p><p> The <att>xml:id</att> attribute may be used to supply a unique identifier for the division,
      which may be used for cross references or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further
      discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>. It is often useful to provide an
       <att>xml:id</att> attribute for every major structural unit in a text, and to derive its
      values in some systematic way, for example by appending a section number to a short code for
      the title of the work in question, as in the examples below. It is particularly useful to
      supply such identifiers if the resource concerned is to be made available over the web, since
      they make it much easier for other web-based applications to link directly to the
      corresponding parts of your text. </p><p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or alternatively) a short
      mnemonic name or number for a division, or any other element. If a conventional form of
      reference or abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the
      book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <att>n</att> attribute is the place to
      record it; unlike the identifier supplied by <att>xml:id</att>, it does not need to be
      unique.</p><p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be used to specify the language of the division.
      Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as further discussed in section
       <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p><p>The <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to supply information about the rendition
      (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-hilites"/> below. As with the <att>type</att> attribute, a project will often
      find it useful to predefine the possible values for this attribute, but TEI Lite does not
      constrain it in anyway. </p><p> These four attributes, <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>, <att>xml:lang</att>, and
       <att>rend</att> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema:
      they are <term>global attributes</term>. Other global attributes defined in the TEI Lite
      scheme are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>The value of every <att>xml:id</att> attribute should be unique within a document. One
      simple way of ensuring that this is so is to make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the
      document. For example, Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published consists of
      five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some chapters are further subdivided
      into parts. We might define <att>xml:id</att> values for this structure as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book"><div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><!-- ... --><div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter"><div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part"><!-- ... --></div></div><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book"><!-- ... --></div></body></egXML></p><p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <att>xml:id</att> and <att>n</att> attributes:
      this is often useful where a canonical reference scheme is used which does not tally with the
      structure of the work. For example, in a novel divided into books each containing chapters,
      where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole work, rather than within each
      book, one might use a scheme such as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="volume"><div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS012" n="2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div></div><div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="volume"><div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS022" n="4" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div></div></body></egXML> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters. The chapters are
      numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <att>xml:id</att> values specified allow them to be
      regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p></div><div xml:id="h25"><head>Headings and Closings</head><p>Every <gi>div</gi> may have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a trailer
      such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q> at its end. The following elements may be used to transcribe
      them: <specList><specDesc key="head"/><specDesc key="trailer"/></specList> Some other elements which may be necessary at the beginning or ending of text
      divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p><p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a matter for the
      individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is completely regular (for example
       <q>Chapter 1</q>) or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g.
       <code>&lt;div type="chapter" n="1"&gt;</code>), it may be omitted; where it contains
      otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's
       <title>Under the Greenwood Tree</title> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="Part"><div xml:id="UGT11" n="1" type="Chapter"><head>Mellstock-Lane</head><p>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ... </p></div></div></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="vedr"><head>Prose, Verse and Drama</head><p>As in the Bronte example above, the paragraphs making up a textual division are tagged with
      the <gi>p</gi> tag. In poetic or dramatic texts different tags are needed, to represent verse
      lines and stanzas in the first case, or individual speeches and stage directions in the
      second. : <specList><specDesc key="l"/><specDesc key="lg"/><specDesc key="sp"/><specDesc key="speaker"/><specDesc key="stage"/></specList>
     </p><p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and stanzas are
      tagged: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg n="I"><l>I Sing the progresse of a
         deathlesse soule,</l><l>Whom Fate, with God made, but doth not controule,</l><l>Plac'd in
         most shapes; all times before the law</l><l>Yoak'd us, and when, and since, in this I
         sing.</l><l>And the great world to his aged evening;</l><l>From infant morne, through manly
         noone I draw.</l><l>What the gold Chaldee, of silver Persian saw,</l><l>Greeke brass, or
         Roman iron, is in this one;</l><l>A worke t'out weare Seths pillars, bricke and
         stone,</l><l>And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,</l></lg></egXML></p><p>Note that the <gi>l</gi> element marks verse lines, not typographic lines: the original
      lineation of the first few lines above has not therefore been made explicit by this encoding,
      and may be lost. The <gi>lb</gi> element described in section <ptr target="#U5-pln"/> might
      additionally be used to mark typographic lines if so desired. </p><p>Here is the end of a famous dramatic text, in which speeches and stage directions are
      marked: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Pull on your trousers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Estragon</speaker><p>You want me to pull off my trousers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Pull <emph>on</emph> your trousers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p><stage>(realizing his trousers are down)</stage>.
        True</p></sp><stage>He pulls up his trousers</stage><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Well? Shall we go?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Estragon</speaker><p>Yes, let's go.</p></sp><stage>They do not move.</stage></egXML>
     </p><p>Note that the <gi>stage</gi> (stage direction) element can appear either within a speech or
      between speeches. The <gi>sp</gi> ("speech") element contains, following an optional
       <gi>speaker</gi> element indicating who is speaking, either paragraphs (if the speech is in
      prose) or verse lines or stanzas as in the next example. In this case, it is quite common to
      find that verse lines are split between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use
      the <att>part</att> attribute to indicate that the lines so fragmented are incomplete : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="Act" n="I"><head>ACT I</head><div type="Scene" n="1"><head>SCENE I</head><stage rend="italic"> Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two Sentinels, at several doors</stage><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="Y">Who's there?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.</l></sp><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="I">Long live the King!</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l part="M">Barnardo?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="F">He.</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>You come most carefully upon your hour.</l></sp><!-- ... --></div></div></egXML></p><p>The same mechanism may be applied to stanzas which are divided between two speakers: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div><sp><speaker>First voice</speaker><lg type="stanza" part="I"><l>But why drives on that ship so fast</l><l>Withouten wave or wind?</l></lg></sp><sp><speaker>Second Voice</speaker><lg part="F"><l>The air is cut away before.</l><l>And closes from behind.</l></lg></sp><!-- ... --></div></egXML>
     </p><p>The <gi>sp</gi> element can also be used for dialogue presented in a prose work as if it
      were drama, as in the next example, which also demonstrates the use of the <att>who</att>
      attribute to bear a code identifying the speaker of the piece of dialogue concerned: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div><sp who="#OPI"><speaker>The reverend Doctor Opimian</speaker><p>I do not think I have named a single unpresentable fish.</p></sp><sp who="#GRM"><speaker>Mr Gryll</speaker><p>Bream, Doctor: there is not much to be said for bream.</p></sp><sp who="#OPI"><speaker>The Reverend Doctor Opimian</speaker><p>On the contrary, sir, I think there is much to be said for him. In the first
          place....</p><p>Fish, Miss Gryll -- I could discourse to you on fish by the hour: but for the present I
          will forbear.</p></sp></div></egXML> Here the <att>who</att> attribute values (<code>#OPI</code> etc.) are links,
      pointing to a list of the characters in the novel, each of which has an identifier: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list><head>Characters in the novel</head><item xml:id="OPI"><name>Dr Opimian</name> : named for the famous Roman fine wine</item><item xml:id="GRM"><name>Mr Gryll</name> : named for the mythical Gryllus, one of Ulysses'
         sailors transformed by Circe into a pig, who argues that he was happier in that state than
         as a man</item></list></egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-pln"><head>Page and Line Numbers</head><p>Page and line breaks etc. may be marked with the following elements. <specList><specDesc key="pb"/><specDesc key="lb"/><specDesc key="milestone"/></specList> These elements mark a single point in the text, not a span of text. The global
      <att>n</att> attribute should be used to supply the number of the page or line beginning at
     the tag. </p><p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record its pagination, if only
     to simplify later proof-reading. It is also useful for synchronizing an encoded text with a set
     of page images. Recording the line breaks may be useful for similar reasons.
     <!--; treatment of end-of-line
     hyphenation in printed source texts will require some consideration.--></p><p>If features such as pagination or lineation are marked for more than one edition, specify the
     edition in question using the <att>ed</att> attribute, and supply as many tags are necessary.
     For example, in the following passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different
     editions (<val>ED1</val> and <val>ED2</val>) <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully
       explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and <pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary approved the step
       unreservedly. Diana announced that she would <pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just give me time to get
       over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p></egXML></p><p>A special attribute <att>break</att> may be used to indicate whether or not this empty
     element is considered as a word-breaking, irrespective of any adjacent whitespace. For example,
     in the following encoded sample: </p><p>The <gi>pb</gi> and <gi>lb</gi> elements are special cases of the general class of
      <term>milestone</term> elements which mark reference points within a text. The generic
      <gi>milestone</gi> element can mark any kind of reference point: for example, a column break,
     the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, or in general any significant change
     in the text not marked by an XML element. The names used for types of unit and for editions
     referred to by the <att>ed</att> and <att>unit</att> attributes may be chosen freely, but
     should be documented in the header <gi>refsDecl</gi> element (see <ptr target="#refsdecl"/>).
     The <gi>milestone</gi> element may be used to replace the others, or the others may be used as
     a set; they should not be mixed arbitrarily.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-hilites"><head>Marking Highlighted Phrases</head><div xml:id="faces"><head>Changes of Typeface, etc.</head><p>Highlighted words or phrases are those made visibly different from the rest of the text,
      typically by a change of type font, handwriting style, ink colour etc., which is intended to
      draw the reader's attention to some associated change.</p><p>The global <att>rend</att> attribute can be attached to any element, and used wherever
      necessary to specify details of the highlighting used for it in the source. For example, a
      heading rendered in bold might be tagged <code>&lt;head rend="bold"&gt;</code>, and one in
      italic <code>&lt;head rend="italic"&gt;</code>.</p><p>The values to be used for the
       <att>rend</att> attribute are not specified by the TEI Guidelines, since they will depend
      entirely on the needs of the particular project. Some typical values might include
       <code>italic</code>, <code>bold</code> <!--, <code>sup</code>(erior)--> etc. for font variations;
       <code>center</code>, <code>right</code> etc. for alignment; <code>large</code>,
       <code>small</code> etc. for size; <code>smallcaps</code>, <code>allcaps</code> etc. for type
      variants and so on. Several such words may be used in combination as necessary, but no formal
      syntax is proposed. The full TEI Guidelines provide more rigorous mechanisms, using other W3C
      standards such as CSS, as an alternative to the use of <att>rend</att>. </p><p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons for such changes of
      rendering in a text. In such cases, the element <gi>hi</gi> may be used to mark a sequence of
      highlighted text without making any claim as to its status. <specList><specDesc key="hi"/></specList></p><p>In the following example, the use of a distinct typeface for the subheading and for the
      included name are recorded but not interpreted: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><hi rend="gothic">And this Indenture further
         witnesseth</hi> that the said <hi rend="italic">Walter Shandy</hi>, merchant, in
        consideration of the said intended marriage ...</p></egXML></p><p>Alternatively, where the cause for the highlighting can be identified with confidence, a
      number of other, more specific, elements are available. <specList><specDesc key="emph"/><specDesc key="foreign"/><specDesc key="gloss"/><specDesc key="label"/><specDesc key="mentioned"/><specDesc key="term"/><specDesc key="title"/></specList></p><p>Some features (notably quotations and glosses) may be found in a text either marked by
      highlighting, or with quotation marks. In either case, the elements <gi>q</gi> and
       <gi>gloss</gi> (as discussed in the following section) should be used. If the highlighting is
      to be recorded, use the global <att>rend</att> attribute.</p><p>As an example of the elements defined here, consider the following sentence: <q rend="display">On the one hand the <hi rend="it">Nibelungenlied</hi> is associated with the
       new rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the <hi rend="it">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the
       romances of Chrétien de Troyes, and the German adaptations of these works by Heinrich van
       Veldeke, Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.</q> Interpreting the role of the
      highlighting, the sentence might look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>On the one hand the <title>Nibelungenlied</title>
        is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the <foreign>romans
         d'antiquité</foreign>, the romances of Chrétien de Troyes, ...</p></egXML> Describing only
      the appearance of the original, it might look like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>On the one hand the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France,
        the <hi rend="italic">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the romances of Chrétien de Troyes,
       ...</p></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="z635"><head>Quotations and Related Features</head><p>Like changes of typeface, quotation marks are conventionally used to denote several
      different features within a text, of which the most frequent is quotation. When possible, we
      recommend that the underlying feature be tagged, rather than the simple fact that quotation
      marks appear in the text, using the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="q"/><!--specDesc key="quote"/--><!--specDesc key="said"/--><specDesc key="mentioned"/><specDesc key="soCalled"/><specDesc key="gloss"/></specList>
     </p><p>Here is a simple example of a quotation: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>Few dictionary makers are likely to forget Dr. Johnson's description of the
        lexicographer as <q>a harmless drudge.</q></p></egXML>
     </p><p>To record how a quotation was printed (for example, <term>in-line</term> or set off as a
       <term>display</term> or <term>block quotation</term>), the <att>rend</att> attribute should
      be used. This may also be used to indicate the kind of quotation marks used.</p><p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by ending the quotation
      and beginning it again after the interruption, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>Who-e debel you?</q> — he at last said —
         <q>you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began
        flourishing about me in the dark.</p></egXML> If it is important to convey the idea that the
      two <gi>q</gi> elements together make up a single speech, the linking attributes
       <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> may be used, as described in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or speaker, using the
       <att>who</att> attribute, whether or not this is explicit in the text, as in the following
      example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q who="#Wilson">Spaulding, he came
        down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he
         says:—<q who="#Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed
        man.</q></q></egXML> This example also demonstrates how quotations may be embedded within
      other quotations: one speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p><p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation marks are replaced by the
      tags or whether the tags are added and the quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are
      removed from the text, the <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to record the way in which
      they were rendered in the copy text.</p><p>The full TEI Guidelines provide additional elements to distinguish direct speech,
      quotation, and other typical uses of quotation mark although it is not always possible and may
      not be considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in a text. For
      simplicity, only <gi>q</gi> (which may be used for any such case) has been included in TEI
      Lite. </p></div><div xml:id="z636"><head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head><p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts may be tagged as such in
      one of two ways. If the word or phrase is already tagged for some reason, the element
      indicated should bear a value for the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute indicating the
      language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element <gi>foreign</gi> may be used,
      again using the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>John has real <foreign xml:lang="fr">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p><p>Have you read <title xml:lang="de">Die

     document may be encoded using the elements described in this section. Implicit links (such as
     the association between two parallel texts, or that between a text and its interpretation) may
     be encoded using the linking attributes discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><div xml:id="ptrs"><head>Simple Cross References</head><p>A cross reference from one point within a single document to another can be encoded using
      either of the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="ref"/><specDesc key="ptr"/></specList>
     </p><p>The difference between these two elements is that <gi>ptr</gi> is an empty element, simply
      marking a point from which a link is to be made, whereas <gi>ref</gi> may contain some text as
      well, typically identifying the target of the cross reference. The <gi>ptr</gi> element would
      be used for a cross reference which is to be indicated by some non-verbal means such as a
      symbol or icon, or in an electronic text by a button. It is also useful in document production
      systems, where the formatter can generate the correct verbal form of the cross reference.</p><p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on
        page 34</ref>.</egXML>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML>
      The value of the <att>target</att> attribute on either element may be the identifier of some
      other element within the current document. The passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an
      identifier, and must therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following example,
      the cross reference is to a <gi>div</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... see especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>. ... <div xml:id="SEC12"><head>Concerning Identifiers</head><!-- ... --></div></egXML>
     </p><p>Because the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is global, any element in a TEI document may be
      pointed to in this way. In the following example, a paragraph has been given an identifier so
      that it may be pointed at: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... this is
       discussed in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref> ... <p xml:id="pspec">Links
        may be made to any kind of element ...</p></egXML></p><p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any particular feature of
      a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a
      point in the current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an <gi>anchor</gi>
      element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some sequence of words not otherwise tagged,
      the <gi>seg</gi> element may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are described as
      follows: <specList><specDesc key="anchor"/><specDesc key="seg"/></specList>
     </p><p>In the following (imaginary) example, <gi>ref</gi> elements have been used to represent
      points in this text which are to be linked in some way to other parts of it; in the first case
      to a point, and in the second, to a sequence of words: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point where I
        dozed off</ref>, I noticed that <ref target="#EFGH">three words</ref> had been circled in
       red by a previous reader</egXML></p><p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers (<code>ABCD</code> and
       <code>EFGH</code> in this example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document.
      Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers, the <gi>anchor</gi> and
       <gi>seg</gi> elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ....
        <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ...
       </seg> ...</egXML></p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish amongst different
      purposes for which these general purpose elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are
      discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p></div><div xml:id="xptrs"><head>Pointing to other documents</head><p>So far, we have shown how the elements <gi>ptr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> may be used for
      cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same document as their source.
      However, the same elements may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML document or
      resource, such as a document on the web, or a database component. This is possible because the
      value of the <att>target</att> attribute may be any valid <term>universal resource
       indicator</term> (URI)<note>A full definition of this term, defined by the W3C (the
       consortium which manages the development and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond
       the scope of this tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is the
       familiar <soCalled>URL</soCalled> used to indicate a web page, such as
        <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code></note>. </p><p>A URI may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example
       <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>. The sharp sign indicates that what follows
      it is the identifier of an element to be located within the XML document identified by what
      precedes it: this example will therefore locate an element which has an <att>xml:id</att>
      attribute value of <val>SEC2</val> within the document retrieved from
       <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. In the examples we have discussed so far, the
      part to the left of the sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the
      referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p><p>Parts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more sophisticated mechanisms
      using a special language called Xpath, also defined by the W3C. This is particularly useful
      where the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers and must therefore be located by
      some other means.
      <!--A full specification of the language is well beyond
      the scope of this document; here we provide only a flavour of its power. </p>
     <p>In the XPath language, locations are defined as a series of <term>steps</term>, each one
      identifying some part of the document, often in terms of the locations identified by the
      previous step. For example, you would point to the third sentence of the second paragraph of
      chapter two by selecting chapter two in the first step, the second paragraph in the second
      step, and the third sentence in the last step. A step can be defined in terms of the document
      tree itself, using such concepts as <val>parent</val>, <val>descendent</val>,
       <val>preceding</val>, etc. or, more loosely, in terms of text patterns, word or character
      positions. --></p></div><div xml:id="xatts"><head>Special kinds of Linking</head><p>The following special purpose <term>linking</term> attributes are defined for every element
      in the TEI Lite scheme: <list type="gloss"><label><att>ana</att></label><item>links an element with its interpretation.</item><label><att>corresp</att></label><item>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</item><label><att>next</att></label><item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item><label><att>prev</att></label><item>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</item></list></p><p>The <att>ana</att> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set of abstract analyses
      or interpretations have been defined somewhere within a document, as further discussed in
      section <ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence <q>John
       loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg type="sentence" ana="SVO"><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">John</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#VVI">loves</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">Nancy</seg></seg></egXML> This encoding
      implies the existence elsewhere in the document of elements with identifiers <val>SVO</val>,
       <val>NP1</val>, and <val>VV1</val> where the significance of these particular codes is
      explained. Note the use of the <gi>seg</gi> element to mark particular components of the
      analysis, distinguished by the <att>type</att> attribute.</p><p>The <att>corresp</att> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of representing some
      form of correspondence between two elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it
      may be used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg xml:lang="fr" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1">Jean
        aime Nancy</seg><seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1">John loves
       Nancy</seg></egXML></p><p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the following example, it has
      been used to represent the correspondences between <q rend="inline" type="inline">the
       show</q> and <q>Shirley</q>, and between <q>NBC</q> and <q>the network</q>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which
        made its Friday night debut only a month ago, was not listed on <name xml:id="nbc">NBC</name>'s new schedule, although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="#nbc">the network</seg>
        says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="#shirley">the show</seg> still is being
       considered.</p></egXML></p><p>The <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes provide a simple way of linking together
      the components of a discontinuous element, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q xml:id="Q1a" next="#Q1b">Who-e debel you?</q> —
       he at last said — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a">you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so
       saying, the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-edit1"><head>Editorial Interventions</head><p>The process of encoding an electronic text has much in common with the process of editing a
     manuscript or other text for printed publication. In either case a conscientious editor may
     wish to record both the original state of the source and any editorial correction or other
     change made in it. The elements discussed in this and the next section provide some facilities
     for meeting these needs.</p><div><head>Correction and Normalization</head><p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>correction</term>, that is editorial
      changes introduced where the editor believes the original to be erroneous: <specList><specDesc key="corr"/><specDesc key="sic"/></specList>
     </p><p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>normalization</term>, that is editorial
      changes introduced for the sake of consistency or modernization of a text: <specList><specDesc key="orig"/><specDesc key="reg"/></specList></p><p>As an example, consider this extract from the quarto printing of Shakespeare's <title>Henry
       V</title>. <eg> ... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and a table of green feelds</eg>
     </p><p>A modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here, specifically to modernize
      (or normalise) the Elizabethan spellings of <mentioned>a'</mentioned> and
       <mentioned>feelds</mentioned> for <mentioned>he</mentioned> and <mentioned>fields</mentioned>
      respectively. He or she might also want to emend <mentioned>table</mentioned> to
       <mentioned>babbl'd</mentioned>, following an editorial tradition that goes back to the 18th
      century Shakespearian scholar Lewis Theobald. The following encoding would then be
      appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as
       a pen and <reg>he</reg>
       <corr resp="#Theobald">babbl'd</corr> of green <reg>fields</reg></egXML></p><p>A more conservative or source-oriented editor, however, might want to retain the original,
      but at the same time signal that some of the readings it contains are in some sense anomalous:
       <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and
        <orig>a</orig>
       <sic>table</sic> of green <orig>feelds</orig></egXML></p><p>Finally, a modern digital editor may decide to combine both possibilities in a single
      composite text, using the <gi>choice</gi> element. <specList><specDesc key="choice"/></specList> This allows an editor to mark where alternative readings are possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and
         <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>he</reg></choice>
       <choice><corr resp="#Theobald">babbl'd</corr><sic>table</sic></choice> of green

      </egXML></p></div><div xml:id="U5-edit2"><head>Omissions, Deletions, and Additions</head><p>In addition to correcting or normalizing words and phrases, editors and transcribers may
      also supply missing material, omit material, or transcribe material deleted or crossed out in
      the source. In addition, some material may be particularly hard to transcribe because it is
      hard to make out on the page. The following elements may be used to record such phenomena: <specList><specDesc key="add"/><specDesc key="gap"/><specDesc key="del"/><specDesc key="unclear"/></specList>
     </p><p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by the transcriber, or (in
      manuscript material) by the author or scribe. For example, if the source for an electronic
      text read <q>The following elements are provided for for simple editorial interventions.</q>
      then it might be felt desirable to correct the obvious error, but at the same time to record
      the deletion of the superfluous second <mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements are provided for <del resp="#LB">for</del> simple editorial interventions.</egXML> The attribute value
       <code>#LB</code> on the <att>resp</att> attribute is used to point to a fuller definition
      (typically in a <gi>respStmt</gi> element) for the agency responsible for correcting the
      duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p><p>If the source read <q>The following elements provided for simple editorial
       interventions.</q> (i.e. if the verb had been inadvertently dropped) then the corrected text
      might read: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements <add resp="#LB">are</add> provided for simple editorial interventions.</egXML></p><p>These elements are also used to record
      authorial changes in manuscripts. A manuscript in which the author has first written <q>How it
       galls me, what a galling shadow</q>, then crossed out the word <mentioned>galls</mentioned>
      and inserted <mentioned>dogs</mentioned> might be encoded thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">How it <del hand="#DHL" type="overstrike">galls</del>
       <add hand="#DHL" place="supralinear">dogs</add> me, what a galling shadow</egXML> Again, the

      concerned is to be found<note place="foot">The full TEI provides a range of elements for
       encoding metadata about manuscript production and description, which are not however included
       in TEI Lite</note>. </p><p>Similarly, the <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> elements may be used together to indicate
      the omission of illegible material; the following example also shows the use of <gi>add</gi>
      for a conjectural emendation: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One hundred
       &amp; twenty good regulars joined to me <unclear><gap reason="indecipherable"/></unclear>
       &amp; instantly, would aid me signally <add hand="#ed">in?</add> an enterprise against
       Wilmington.</egXML></p><p>The <gi>del</gi> element marks material which has been transcribed as part of the electronic text
      despite being marked as deleted, while <gi>gap</gi> marks the location of material which is
      omitted from the electronic text, whether it is legible or not. A language corpus, for
      example, might omit long quotations in foreign languages: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p> ... An example of a list appearing in a fief
        ledger of <name type="place">Koldinghus</name>
        <date>1611/12</date> is given below. It shows cash income from a sale of
         honey.</p><gap><desc>quotation from ledger (in Danish)</desc></gap><p>A description of the
        overall structure of the account is once again ... </p></egXML></p><p>Other corpora (particular those constructed before the widespread use of scanners)
      systematically omit figures and mathematics: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>At the bottom of your screen below the mode line is the <term>minibuffer</term>. This is
        the area where Emacs echoes the commands you enter and where you specify filenames for Emacs

          Emacs screen</desc></gap>
       </p></egXML></p><p>The full TEI scheme provides more precise ways of capturing
different aspects of  a transcription, distinguishing for example
between text added or supplied by the encoder and text indicated as
supplied or deleted in the source. TEI Lite does not provide different
tags for these purposes.</p></div><div><head>Abbreviations and their Expansion</head><p>Like names, dates, and numbers, abbreviations may be transcribed as they stand or expanded;
      they may be left unmarked, or encoded using the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="abbr"/><specDesc key="expan"/></specList>
     </p><p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing semi-lexical items such as
      acronyms or jargon: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">We can sum up the above
       discussion as follows: the identity of a <abbr>CC</abbr> is defined by that calibration of
       values which motivates the elements of its <abbr>GSP</abbr>;</egXML>
      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Every manufacturer of <abbr>3GL</abbr> or
        <abbr>4GL</abbr> languages is currently nailing on <abbr>OOP</abbr> extensions</egXML>
     </p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish types of abbreviation by their
      function. </p><p>The <gi>expan</gi> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by an encoder. This element
      is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript materials. For example, the
      character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional representation for the word
       <val>per</val> is commonly encountered in Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may
      choose to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>per</expan></egXML>
     </p><p>The expansion corresponding with an abbreviated form may not always contain the same letters
      as the abbreviation. Where it does, however, common editorial practice is to italicize or
      otherwise signal which letters have been supplied. The <gi>expan</gi> element should not be
      used for this purpose since its function is to indicate an expanded form, not a part of one.
      For example, consider the common abbreviation <val>wt</val> (for <val>with</val>) found in
      medieval texts. In a modern edition, an editor might wish to represent this as <soCalled>w<hi rend="it">i</hi>t<hi rend="it">h</hi></soCalled>, italicising the letters not found in the
      source. One simple means of achieving that would be an encoding such as the follow<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>w<hi rend="it">i</hi>t<hi rend="it">h</hi></expan></egXML>
     The full TEI also provides elements <gi>ex</gi> and <gi>am</gi>
     for use in this situation, but these are not included in the TEI Lite
     schema.</p><p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the <gi>choice</gi> element mentioned
      above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>wt</abbr><expan>with</expan></choice></egXML>
     </p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-names"><head>Names, Dates, and Numbers</head><p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of <soCalled>data-like</soCalled> features
     which may appear almost anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of
     particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to objects external to the text
     itself, such as the names of persons and places, numbers and dates. They also pose particular
     problems for many natural language processing (NLP) applications because of the variety of ways
     in which they may be presented within a text. The elements described here, by making such
     features explicit, reduce the complexity of processing texts containing them.</p><div xml:id="nomen"><head>Names and Referring Strings</head><p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some person, place, object, etc.

      element, or nested within it if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper
      nouns.</p><p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic processing of
      personal names into the canonical forms usually required for reference purposes. The name as
      it appears in the text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague. Moreover, name
      prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>, may or may not be
      included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the language and country of
      origin of the bearer.</p><p>The <att>key</att> attribute provides an alternative normalized identifier for the object
      being named, like a database record key. It may thus be useful as a means of gathering
      together all references to the same individual or location scattered throughout a document:
       <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person" key="BENM1">Mr.
         Bennet</rs>, </q> said <rs type="person" key="BENM2">his lady</rs> to him one day, <q>have
        you heard that <rs type="place" key="NETP1">Netherfield Park</rs> is let at
       last?</q></egXML></p><p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the <gi>reg</gi> (regularization) element,
      which provides a means of marking the standard form of a referencing string as demonstrated
      below: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><name type="person" key="WADLM1"><choice><sic>Walter de la Mare</sic><reg>de la Mare, Walter</reg></choice></name> was
       born at <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in <name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</egXML></p><p>The <gi>index</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="indexing"/> may be more appropriate if
      the function of the regularization is to provide a consistent index: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><name type="place">Montaillou</name> is not a
        large parish. At the time of the events which led to <name type="person">Fournier</name>'s
          <index><term>Benedict XII, Pope of Avignon (Jacques Fournier)</term></index>
        investigations, the local population consisted of between 200 and 250
       inhabitants.</p></egXML> Although adequate for many simple applications, these methods have
      two inconveniences: if the name occurs many times, then its regularised form must be repeated
      many times; and the burden of additional XML markup in the body of the text may be
      inconvenient to maintain and complex to process. For applications such as onomastics, relating
      to persons or places named rather than the name itself, or wherever a detailed analysis of the
      component parts of a name is needed, the full TEI Guidelines provide a range of other
      solutions.</p></div><div><head>Dates and Times</head><p>Tags for the more detailed encoding of times and dates include the following: <specList><specDesc key="date"/><specDesc key="time"/></specList>
     </p><p>These elements have a number of attributes which can be used to provide normalised versions
      of their values. <specList><specDesc key="att.datable" atts="calendar period when"/></specList> The <att>when</att>
      attribute specifies a normalized form for the date or time, using one of the standard formats
      defined by ISO 8601. Partial dates or times (e.g. <q>1990</q>, <q>September 1990</q>,
       <q>twelvish</q>) can be expressed by omitting a part of the value supplied, as in the
      following examples: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when="1980-02-21">21

        am</date></egXML>Note in the last example the use of a normalized representation for the
      date string which includes a time: this example could thus equally well be tagged using the

       <mentioned>123,456.78</mentioned> equals French <mentioned>123.456,78</mentioned>). In
      natural-language processing or machine-translation applications, it is often helpful to
      distinguish them from other, more <soCalled>lexical</soCalled> parts of the text. In other
      applications, the ability to record a number's value in standard notation is important. The

    </p><p>Individual list items are tagged with <gi>item</gi>. The first <gi>item</gi> may optionally
     be preceded by a <gi>head</gi>, which gives a heading for the list. The numbering of a list may
     be omitted, indicated using the <att>n</att> attribute on each item, or (rarely) tagged as
     content using the <gi>label</gi> element. The following are all thus equivalent: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list><head>A short list</head><item>First item in list.</item><item>Second item in list.</item><item>Third item in list.</item></list><list><head>A short list</head><item n="1">First item in list.</item><item n="2">Second item in list.</item><item n="3">Third item in list.</item></list><list><head>A short list</head><label>1</label><item>First item in list.</item><label>2</label><item>Second item in list.</item><label>3</label><item>Third item in list.</item></list></egXML> The styles should not be mixed in the same list.</p><p>A simple two-column table may be treated as a <term>glossary list</term>, tagged
      <code>&lt;list type="gloss"&gt;</code>. Here, each item comprises a <term>term</term> and a
      <term>gloss</term>, marked with <gi>label</gi> and <gi>item</gi> respectively. These
     correspond to the elements <gi>term</gi> and <gi>gloss</gi>, which can occur anywhere in prose

     the list as a <term>table</term>, for which special-purpose tagging is defined below (<ptr target="#U5-tables"/>). </p><p>Lists of whatever kind can, of course, nest within list items to any depth required. Here,
     for example, a glossary list contains two items, each of which is itself a simple list: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><list type="gloss"><label>EVIL</label><item><list type="simple"><item>I am cast upon a horrible desolate island, void of all hope of recovery.</item><item>I am singled out and separated as it were from all the world to be miserable.</item><item>I am divided from mankind — a solitaire; one banished from human society.</item></list></item><label>GOOD</label><item><list type="simple"><item>But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship's company were.</item><item>But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's crew, to be spared from

     appropriate. It is generally useful to mark at least those parts (such as the titles of

     will often contain diagrams or illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which image and
     text are inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are complementary. </p><p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the text, possibly with a
     brief description of its content, and may also provide a link to a digitized version of the
     graphic, using the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="graphic"/><specDesc key="figure"/><specDesc key="figDesc"/></specList></p><p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a heading and/or caption, may be
     included within the <gi>figure</gi> element itself, in a <gi>head</gi> and one or more
      <gi>p</gi> elements, as also may any text appearing within the graphic itself. It is strongly
     recommended that a prose description of the image be supplied, as the content of a
      <gi>figDesc</gi> element, for the use of applications which are not able to render the
     graphic, and to render the document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text is not
     normally considered part of the document proper.)</p><p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a graphic and provide a link
     to it, as in this example; <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="412"/><figure><graphic url="p412fig.png"/></figure><pb n="413"/></egXML> This indicates that the
     graphic contained by the file <ident>p412fig.png</ident> appears between pages 412 and 413. </p><p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element can appear anywhere that textual content is permitted, within
     but not between paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has decided to
     treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/></head></egXML>
    </p><p>More usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title, which may be encoded
     using the <gi>head</gi> element, or a number of figures may be grouped together in a particular
     structure. It is also often convenient to include a brief description of the image. The
      <gi>figure</gi> element provides a means of wrapping one or more such elements together as a
     kind of graphic <soCalled>block</soCalled>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><figure><graphic url="fessipic.png"/><head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head><figDesc>A Cruikshank
        engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading a group of revellers.</figDesc></figure></egXML></p><p>These cases should be carefully distinguished from the case where an encoded text is
     complemented by a collection of digital images, maintained as a distinct resource. The
      <att>facs</att> attribute may be used to associate any element in an encoded text with a
     digital facsimile of it. In the simple case where only page images are available, the
      <att>facs</att> attribute on the <gi>pb</gi> element may be used to associate each image with
     an appropriate point in the text: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text><pb facs="page1.png" n="1"/><!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here --><pb facs="page2.png" n="2"/><!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here --></text></egXML> This method is only appropriate in the simple case where each digital image file
      <ident>page1.png</ident> etc. corresponds with a single transcribed and encoded page. If more
     detailed alignment of image and transcription is required, for example because the image files
     actually represent double page spreads, more sophisticated mechanisms are provided in the full
     TEI Guidelines. </p></div><div xml:id="U5-anal"><head>Interpretation and Analysis</head><p>It is often said that <emph>all</emph> markup is a form of interpretation or analysis. While
     it is certainly difficult, and may be impossible, to distinguish firmly between
      <soCalled>objective</soCalled> and <soCalled>subjective</soCalled> information in any
     universal way, it remains true that judgments concerning the latter are typically regarded as
     more likely to provide controversy than those concerning the former. Many scholars therefore
     prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible to alert the reader that they are
     considered more open to dispute, than the rest of the markup. This section describes some of
     the elements provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need. </p><div><head>Orthographic Sentences</head><p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no particular respect to
      other structural units. A useful preliminary to intensive interpretation is therefore to
      segment the text into discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label for
      use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>. To facilitate such uses, these
      units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may conveniently be
      represented using the following element: <specList><specDesc key="s"/></specList></p><p>As the name suggests, the <gi>s</gi> element is most commonly used (in linguistic
      applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic sentences</term>, that is, units defined
      by orthographic features such as punctuation. For example, the passage from <title>Jane
       Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="474"/><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s><s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s><s n="003">he
          and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.</s><s n="004">When we got back from
          church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner, and
          John cleaning the knives, and I said —</s></p><p><q><s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</s></q> ... </p></div></egXML> Note that <gi>s</gi> elements cannot nest: the beginning of one <gi>s</gi>
      element implies that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown above, it
      is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in the text being analysed
      will be contained by exactly one <gi>s</gi> element, whose identifier can then be used to
      specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the document,
      then the <att>xml:id</att> attribute might be used in preference to the <att>n</att> used in
      the above example.</p></div><div><head>Words and punctuation</head><p>Tokenization, that is, the identification of
      lexical or non-lexical tokens within a text, is a very common requirement for all kinds of
      textual analysis, and not an entirely trivial one. The decision as to whether, for example,
       <q>can't</q> in English or <q>du</q> in French should be treated as one word or two is not
      simple. Consequently it is often useful to make explicit the preferred tokenization in a
      marked up text. The following elements are available for this purpose: <specList><specDesc key="w"/><specDesc key="pc"/></specList></p><p>For example, the output from a part of speech tagger might be recorded in TEI Lite as
      follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s n="1"><w ana="#NP0">Marley</w><w ana="#VBD">was</w><w ana="#AJ0">dead</w><pc>:</pc><w ana="#TO0">to</w><w ana="#VBB">begin</w><w ana="#PRP">with</w><pc>. </pc></s></egXML>
     </p><p>In this example, each word has been decorated with an automatically generated part of
      speech code, using the <att>ana</att> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>
      above. The <gi>w</gi> also provides for each word to be associated with a root form or lemma,
      either explicitly using the <att>lemma</att> attribute, or by reference, using the
       <att>lemmaRef</att> attribute, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...<w ana="#VBD" lemma="be" lemmaRef="http://www.myLexicon.com/be">was</w> ... </egXML>
     </p></div><div><head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head><p>The <gi>w</gi> element is a specialisation of the <gi>seg</gi> element which has already
      been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked targets of cross references and
      hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>); it identifies some phrase-level
      portion of text to which the encoder may assign a user-specified <att>type</att>, as well as a
      unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for which there is no other
      provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p><p>For example, the Guidelines provide no <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled> element to mark parts
      of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer) directly. One
      approach might be to regard these as instances of the <gi>q</gi> element, distinguished from
      others by an appropriate value for the <att>who</att> attribute. A possibly simpler, and
      certainly more general, solution would however be to use the <gi>seg</gi> element as follows:
       <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg> A quiet wedding we had: ...</p></div></egXML> The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element can take any value,
      and so can be used to record phrase-level phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record
      the values used and their significance in the header.</p><p>A <gi>seg</gi> element of one type (unlike the <gi>s</gi> element which it superficially
      resembles) can be nested within a <gi>seg</gi> element of the same or another type. This
      enables quite complex structures to be represented; some examples were given in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. However, because it must respect the requirement that elements be
      properly nested and may not cut across each other, it cannot cope with the common requirement
      to associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments of a text which may completely ignore
      the document hierarchy. It also requires that the interpretation itself be represented by a
      single coded value in the <att>type</att> attribute.</p><p>Neither restriction applies to the <gi>interp</gi> element, which provides powerful features
      for the encoding of quite complex interpretive information in a relatively straightforward
      manner. <specList><specDesc key="interp"/><specDesc key="interpGrp"/></specList> These elements allow the encoder to specify both the class of an interpretation,
      and the particular instance of that class which the interpretation involves. Thus, whereas
      with <gi>seg</gi> one can say simply that something is an apostrophe, with <gi>interp</gi> one
      can say that it is an instance (apostrophe) of a larger class (rhetorical figures).</p><p>Moreover, <gi>interp</gi> is a <soCalled>stand off</soCalled>
     element: it does not surround the segments of text which it
     describes, but instead is  linked to the passage in question
      either by means of the <att>ana</att> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above, or by means of its own <att>inst</att> attribute. This means that
      any kind of analysis can be represented, independently of the
      document hierarchy, as well as
       facilitating the grouping of analyses of a particular type together. A special purpose
       <gi>interpGrp</gi> element is provided for the latter purpose.</p><p>For example, suppose that you wish to mark such diverse aspects of a text as themes or
      subject matter, rhetorical figures, and the locations of individual scenes of the narrative.
      Different portions of our sample passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> for example, might be
      associated with the rhetorical figures of apostrophe, hyperbole, and metaphor; with
      subject-matter references to churches, servants, cooking, postal service, and honeymoons; and
      with scenes located in the church, in the kitchen, and in an unspecified location (drawing
      room?).</p><p>These interpretations could be placed anywhere within the <gi>text</gi> element; it is
      however good practice to put them all in the same place (e.g. a separate section of the front
      or back matter), as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interp xml:id="fig-apos-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="fig-hyp-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">hyperbole</interp><interp xml:id="set-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="setting">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-serv-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">servants</interp></p></div></back></egXML></p><p>The evident redundancy of this encoding can be considerably reduced by using the
       <gi>interpGrp</gi> element to group together all those <gi>interp</gi> elements which share
      common attribute values, as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interpGrp type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="fig-apos">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="fig-hyp">hyperbole</interp><interp xml:id="fig-meta">metaphor</interp></interpGrp><interpGrp type="scene-setting" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="set-church">church</interp><interp xml:id="set-kitch">kitchen</interp><interp xml:id="set-unspec">unspecified</interp></interpGrp><interpGrp type="reference" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="ref-church">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-serv">servants</interp><interp xml:id="ref-cook">cooking</interp></interpGrp></p></div></back></egXML></p><p>Once these interpretation elements have been defined, they can be linked with the parts of
      the text to which they apply in either or both of two ways. The <att>ana</att> attribute can
      be used on whichever element is appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p xml:id="P38.1" ana="#set-church #set-kitch"><s xml:id="P38.1.1" ana="#fig-apos">Reader, I
          married him.</s></p></div></egXML> Note in this example that since the paragraph has two settings (in the church
      and in the kitchen), the identifiers of both have been supplied.</p><p>Alternatively, the <gi>interp</gi> elements can point to all the parts of the text to which
      they apply, using their <att>inst</att> attribute: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="fig-apos-2" type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM" inst="#P38.1.1">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="set-church-2" type="scene-setting" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM">church</interp><interp xml:id="set-kitchen-2" type="scene-setting" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM">kitchen</interp></egXML></p><p>The <gi>interp</gi> element is not limited to any particular type of analysis. The literary
      analysis shown above is but one possibility; one could equally well use <gi>interp</gi> to
      capture a linguistic part-of-speech analysis. For example, the example sentence given in
      section <ptr target="#xatts"/> assumes a linguistic analysis which might be represented as
      follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="NP1" type="pos">noun
        phrase, singular</interp><interp xml:id="VV1" type="pos">inflected verb, present-tense
        singular</interp> ... </egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-techdoc"><head>Technical Documentation</head><p>Although the focus of this document is on the use of the TEI scheme for the encoding of
     existing <soCalled>pre-electronic</soCalled> documents, the same scheme may also be used for
     the encoding of new documents. In the preparation of new documents (such as this one), XML has
     much to recommend it: the document's structure can be clearly represented, and the same
     electronic text can be re-used for many purposes — to provide both online hypertext or
     browsable versions and well-formatted typeset versions from a common source for example. </p><p>To facilitate this, the TEI Lite schema includes some elements for marking features of
     technical documents in general, and of XML-related documents in particular.</p><div><head>Additional Elements for Technical Documents</head><p>The following elements may be used to mark particular features of technical documents: <specList><specDesc key="eg"/><specDesc key="code"/><specDesc key="ident"/><specDesc key="gi"/><specDesc key="att"/><specDesc key="formula"/><specDesc key="val"/></specList></p><p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to encode a passage from a
      tutorial introducing the Fortran programming language: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>It is traditional to introduce a language with a
        program like the following: <eg xml:space="preserve"> CHAR*12 GRTG
GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD' 
PRINT *, GRTG 
END
        </eg></p><p>This simple example first declares a variable <ident>GRTG</ident>, in the line
         <code>CHAR*12 GRTG</code>, which identifies <ident>GRTG</ident> as consisting of 12 bytes
        of type <ident>CHAR</ident>. To this variable, the value <val>HELLO WORLD</val> is then
        assigned.</p></egXML></p><p>A formatting application, given a text like that above, can be instructed to format examples
      appropriately (e.g. to preserve line breaks, or to use a distinctive font). Similarly, the use
      of tags such as <gi>ident</gi> greatly facilitates the construction of a useful index.</p><p>The <gi>formula</gi> element should be used to enclose a mathematical or chemical formula
      presented within the text as a distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety
      of special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text, it will usually be
      necessary to present the body of the formula in a specialized notation. The notation used
      should be specified by the <att>notation</att> attribute, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><formula notation="tex"> \begin{math}E =
        mc^{2}\end{math} </formula></egXML></p><p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the subject of discussion within a
      technical document, itself encoded in XML. In such a document, it is clearly essential to
      distinguish clearly the markup occurring within examples from that marking up the document
      itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One simple solution is to use the predefined
      entity reference <code>&amp;lt;</code> to represent each &lt; character which marks the start
      of an XML tag within the examples. A more general solution is to mark off the whole body of
      each example as containing data which is not to be scanned for XML mark-up by the parser. This
      is achieved by enclosing it within a special XML construct called a <term><code>CDATA</code>
       marked section</term>, as in the following example: <eg xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;A list should be encoded as
       follows: &lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [ &lt;list&gt; &lt;item&gt;First item in the
       list&lt;/item&gt; &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/list&gt; ]]&gt; &lt;/eg&gt; The
       &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt;
       elements.</eg></p><p>The <gi>list</gi> element used within the example above will not be regarded as forming part
      of the document proper, because it is embedded within a marked section (beginning with the
      special markup declaration <val>&lt;![CDATA[ </val>, and ending with <val>]]&gt;</val>).</p><p>Note also the use of the <gi>gi</gi> element to tag references to element names (or
       <term>generic identifiers</term>) within the body of the text.</p></div><div><head>Generated Divisions</head><p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to generate automatically whole
      sections such as a table of contents or an index. The TEI Lite scheme provides an element to
      mark the location at which such a generated section should be placed. <specList><specDesc key="divGen"/></specList></p><p>The <gi>divGen</gi> element can be placed anywhere that a division element would be legal,
      as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><front><titlePage><!-- ... --></titlePage><divGen type="toc"/><div><head>Preface</head><!-- ... --></div></front><body><!-- ... --></body><back><div><head>Appendix</head><!-- ... --></div><divGen type="index" n="Index"/></back></egXML></p><p>This example also demonstrates the use of the <att>type</att> attribute to distinguish the
      different kinds of division to be generated: in the first case a table of contents (a
       <mentioned>toc</mentioned>) and in the second an index.</p><p>When an existing index or table of contents is to be encoded (rather than one being
      generated) for some reason, the <gi>list</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-lists"/> should be used. </p></div><div xml:id="indexing"><head>Index Generation</head><p>While production of a table of contents from a properly tagged document is generally
      unproblematic for an automatic processor, the production of a good quality index will often
      require more careful tagging. It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts
      tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all occurrences of elements
      such as <gi>term</gi> or <gi>name</gi> will often be a good departure point for an index. </p><p>The TEI schema provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag which may be used to mark both
      the parts of the document which should be indexed, and how the indexing should be done. <specList><specDesc key="index"/></specList></p><p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... TEI lite also provides a special purpose
        <gi>index</gi> tag <index><term>indexing</term></index>
       <index><term>index (tag)</term><index><term>use in index generation</term></index></index>
       which may be used ...</egXML></p><p>The <gi>index</gi> element can also be used to provide a form of interpretive or analytic
      information. For example, in a study of Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's
      references to different figures, for comparative stylistic study. In the following lines of
      the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, such a study would record the poet's references to Jupiter
      (as <mentioned>deus</mentioned>, <mentioned>se</mentioned>, and as the subject of
       <mentioned>confiteor</mentioned> [in inflectional form number 227]), to
      Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as <mentioned>imago tauri fallacis</mentioned> and the subject
      of <mentioned>teneo</mentioned>), and so on.<note place="foot">The analysis is taken, with
       permission, from Willard McCarty and Burton Wright, <title>An Analytical Onomasticon to the
        Metamorphoses of Ovid</title> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming). Some
       simplifications have been undertaken.</note>

      need might be met using the <gi>note</gi> element discussed in section in <ptr target="#U5-notes"/>, or with the <gi>interp</gi> element discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. Here we demonstrate how it might also be satisfied by using the
       <gi>index</gi> element.</p><p>We assume that the object is to generate more than one index: one for names of deities
      (called <att>dn</att>), another for onomastic references (called <att>on</att>), a third for
      pronominal references (called <att>pr</att>) and so forth. One way of achieving this might be
      as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><l n="3.001">iamque deus posita
        fallacis imagine tauri <index indexName="dn"><term>Iuppiter</term><index><term>deus</term></index></index>
        <index indexName="on"><term>Iuppiter (taurus)</term><index><term>imago tauri
          fallacis</term></index></index></l><l n="3.002">se confessus erat Dictaeaque rura tenebat
         <index indexName="pr"><term>Iuppiter</term><index><term>se</term></index></index>
        <index indexName="v"><term>Iuppiter</term><index><term>confiteor
         (v227)</term></index></index></l></egXML> For each <gi>index</gi> element above, an entry
      will be generated in the appropriate index, using as headword the content of the <gi>term</gi>
      element it contains; the <gi>term</gi> elements nested within the secondary <gi>index</gi>
      element in each case provide a secondary keyword. The actual reference will be taken from the
      context in which the <gi>index</gi> element appears, i.e. in this case the identifier of the
       <gi>l</gi> element containing it. </p></div><div><head>Addresses</head><p>The <gi>address</gi> element is used to mark a postal address of any kind. It contains one
      or more <gi>addrLine</gi> elements, one for each line of the address. <specList><specDesc key="address"/><specDesc key="addrLine"/></specList>
     </p><p>Here is a simple example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address><addrLine>Computer Center (M/C 135)</addrLine><addrLine>1940 W. Taylor, Room 124</addrLine><addrLine>Chicago, IL 60612-7352</addrLine><addrLine>U.S.A.</addrLine></address></egXML></p><p>The individual parts of an address may be further distinguished by using the <gi>name</gi>
      element discussed above (section <ptr target="#nomen"/>). <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><address><addrLine>Computer Center (M/C 135)</addrLine><addrLine>1940 W.

     documents, most problems previously associated with the representation of the divers languages
     and writing systems of the world are greatly reduced. For those working with standard forms of
     the European languages in particular, almost no special action is needed: any XML editor should
     enable you to input accented letters or other <soCalled>non-ASCII</soCalled> characters
     directly, and they should be stored in the resulting file in a way which is transferable
     directly between different systems. </p><p>There are two important exceptions: the characters &amp; and &lt; may not be entered directly
     in an XML document, since they have a special significance as initiating markup. They must
     always be represented as <term>entity references</term>, like this: <code>&amp;amp;</code> or
      <code>&amp;lt;</code>. Other characters may also be represented by means of entity reference
     where necessary, for example to retain compatibility with a pre-Unicode processing system. </p></div><div xml:id="U5-fronbac"><head>Front and Back Matter</head><div><head>Front Matter</head><p>For many purposes, particularly in older texts, the preliminary material such as title

        <gi>div</gi> elements; the following suggested values for the <att>type</att> attribute may
       be used to distinguish various common types of prefatory matter: <list type="gloss"><label>preface</label><item>A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or publisher

       the text. Typically this description should cover such topics as the following, each of which
       may conveniently be given as a separate paragraph. <list type="gloss"><label>correction </label><item>how and under what circumstances corrections have been made in the text.</item><label>normalization</label><item>the extent to which the original source has been regularized or normalized.</item><label>quotation</label><item>what has been done with quotation marks in the original -- have they been retained or
         replaced by entity references, are opening and closing quotes distinguished, etc. </item><label>hyphenation</label><item>what has been done with hyphens (especially end-of-line hyphens) in the original --
         have they been retained, replaced by entity references, etc.</item><label>segmentation</label><item>how has the text has been segmented, for example into sentences, tone-units, graphemic
         strata, etc.</item><label>interpretation</label><item>what analytic or interpretive information has been added to the text. </item></list></p><p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><editorialDecl><p>The part of
          speech analysis applied throughout section 4 was added by hand and has not been
          checked.</p><p>Errors in transcription controlled by using the WordPerfect spelling
          checker.</p><p>All words converted to Modern American spelling using Webster's 9th
          Collegiate dictionary.</p></editorialDecl></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="refsdecl"><head>Reference and Classification Declarations</head><p>The <gi>refsDecl</gi> element is used to document the way in which any standard referencing
       scheme built into the encoding works. In its simplest form, it consists of prose
       description.</p><p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><refsDecl><p>The <att>n</att>
          attribute on each <gi>div</gi> contains the canonical reference for each division in the
          form XX.yyy where XX is the book number in roman numeral and yyy is the section number in
          arabic.</p><p>Milestone tags refer to the edition of 1830 as E30 and that of 1850 as E50.
         </p></refsDecl></egXML></p><p>The <gi>classDecl</gi> element groups together definitions or sources for any descriptive
       classification schemes used by other parts of the header. At least one such scheme must be
       provided, encoded using the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="taxonomy"/><specDesc key="bibl"/><specDesc key="category"/><specDesc key="catDesc"/></specList></p><p> In the simplest case, the taxonomy may be defined by a bibliographic reference, as in the
       following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classDecl><taxonomy xml:id="LC-SH"><bibl>Library of Congress Subject Headings
        </bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></egXML></p><p>Alternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special purpose classification
       scheme, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><taxonomy xml:id="B"><bibl>Brown Corpus</bibl><category xml:id="B.A"><catDesc>Press
           Reportage</catDesc><category xml:id="B.A1"><catDesc>Daily</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A2"><catDesc>Sunday</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A3"><catDesc>National</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A4"><catDesc>Provincial</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A5"><catDesc>Political</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A6"><catDesc>Sports</catDesc></category></category><category xml:id="B.D"><catDesc>Religion</catDesc><category xml:id="B.D1"><catDesc>Books</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.D2"><catDesc>Periodicals and
            tracts</catDesc></category></category></taxonomy></egXML></p><p>Linkage between a particular text and a category within such a taxonomy is made by means of
       the <gi>catRef</gi> element within the <gi>textClass</gi> element, as described in the next
       section below.</p></div></div><div><head>The Profile Description</head><p>The <gi>profileDesc</gi> element enables information characterizing various descriptive
      aspects of a text to be recorded within a single framework. It has three optional components: <specList><specDesc key="creation"/><specDesc key="langUsage"/><specDesc key="textClass"/></specList></p><p>The <gi>creation</gi> element is useful for documenting where a work was created, even
      though it may not have been published or recorded there.</p><p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><creation><date when="1992-08">August 1992</date><name type="place">Taos, New Mexico</name></creation></egXML></p><p>The <gi>langUsage</gi> element is useful where a text contains many different languages. It
      may contain <gi>language</gi> elements to document each particular language used: <specList><specDesc key="language"/></specList> For example, a text containing predominantly text in French as spoken in Quebec,
      but also smaller amounts of British and Canadian English might be documented as follows:
       <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><langUsage><language ident="fr-CA" usage="60">Québecois</language><language ident="en-CA" usage="20">Canadian business English</language><language ident="en-GB" usage="20">British English</language></langUsage></egXML>
     </p><p>The <gi>textClass</gi> element classifies a text. This may be done with reference to a
      classification system locally defined by means of the <gi>classDecl</gi> element, or by
      reference to some externally defined established scheme such as the Universal Decimal
      Classification. Texts may also be classified using lists of keywords, which may themselves be
      drawn from locally or externally defined control lists. The following elements are used to
      supply such classifications: <specList><specDesc key="classCode"/><specDesc key="catRef"/><specDesc key="keywords"/></specList>
     </p><p>The simplest way of classifying a text is by means of the <gi>classCode</gi> element. For
      example, a text with classification 410 in the Universal Decimal Classification might be
      documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classCode scheme="http://www.udc.org">410</classCode></egXML>
     </p><p>When a classification scheme has been locally defined using the <gi>taxonomy</gi> element
      discussed in the preceding subsection, the <gi>catRef</gi> element should be used to reference
      it. To continue the earlier example, a work classified in the Brown Corpus as <code>Press
       reportage - Sunday</code> and also as <code>Religion</code> might be documented as follows:
       <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catRef target="#B.A3 #B.D"/></egXML>
     </p><p>The element <gi>keywords</gi> contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic
      or nature of a text. As usual, the attribute <att>scheme</att> identifies the source from
      which these terms are taken. For example, if the LC Subject Headings are used, following
      declaration of that classification system in a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element as above : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><textClass><keywords scheme="#LCSH"><list><item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Data processing.</item><item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Theory etc.</item><item>English language -- Style -- Data processing.</item></list></keywords></textClass></egXML></p><p>Multiple classifications may be supplied using
      any of the mechanisms described in this section.</p></div><div><head>The Revision Description</head><p>The <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element provides a change log in which each change made to a text
      may be recorded. The log may be recorded as a sequence of <gi>change</gi> elements each of
      which contains a brief description of the change. The attributes <att>when</att> and
       <att>who</att> may be used to identify when the change was carried out and the agency
      responsible for it. </p><p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><revisionDesc><change when="1991-03-06" who="#EMB">File format updated</change><change when="1990-05-25" who="#EMB">Stuart's corrections entered</change></revisionDesc></egXML></p><p>In a production environment it will usually be found preferable to use some kind of
      automated system to track and record changes. Many such <term>version control systems</term>,
      as they are known, can also be configured to update the TEI Header of a file automatically.
     </p></div></div></body><back><div><head>List of Elements Described</head><p>The TEI Lite schema is a pure subset of TEI P5. In the following list of elements and classes

    <p>ISO 12620:2009 is a standard describing the data model and procedures for a Data
      Category Registry (DCR). Data categories are defined as elementary descriptors in a
      linguistic structure. In the DCR data model each data category gets assigned a
      unique Peristent IDentifier (PID), i.e., an URI. Linguistic resources or preferably
      their schemas that make use of data categories from a DCR should refer to them using
      this PID. For XML-based resources, like TEI documents, ISO 12620:2009 normative
      Annex A gives a small Data Category Reference XML vocabulary (also available online
      at <ref target="http://www.isocat.org/12620/">http://www.isocat.org/12620/</ref>),

        <p>Note that a simple <att>resp</att> pointing to a person or 
          organization is likely to be somewhat ambiguous with regard 
          to the nature of the responsibility. For this reason, we 
          recommend that <att>resp</att> be used to point not to an agent 
          (<gi>person</gi> or <gi>org</gi>) but to a <gi>respStmt</gi>, 
          <gi>author</gi>, <gi>editor</gi> or similar 
          element which clarifies the exact role played by the agent. 
          Pointing to multiple <gi>respStmt</gi>s allows the encoder to specify 
          clearly each of the roles played in part of a TEI file (creating, 
          transcribing, encoding, editing, proofing etc.).</p></remarks>

        <p>The xml:lang value will be inherited from the immediately
enclosing element, or from its parent, and so on up the document hierarchy.
It is generally good practice to specify xml:lang at the highest
appropriate level, noticing that a different default may be needed for the
teiHeader from that needed for the associated resource element or elements,
and that a single TEI document may contain texts in many languages.</p>
        <p>The authoritative list of registered language subtags is maintained by IANA and 
          is available at <ptr target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"/>. 
          For a good general overview of the construction of language tags, see 
          <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/"/>, and for 
          a practical step-by-step guide, see 
          <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags"/>.</p>
<p>The value used must conform with BCP 47. If the value is a
      private use code (i.e., starts with <val>x-</val> or contains
      <val>-x-</val>), a <gi>language</gi> element with a matching
      value for its <att>ident</att> attribute should be supplied in
      the TEI header to document this value. Such documentation may
      also optionally be supplied for non-private-use codes, though
      these must remain consistent with their

    <p>The values for this attribute are language <soCalled>tags</soCalled> as defined in <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>. Currently BCP 47 comprises RFC 4646
      and RFC 4647; over time, other IETF documents may succeed these as the best current practice.</p>
    <p>A <soCalled>language tag</soCalled>, per BCP 47, is assembled from a sequence of components
      or <term>subtags</term> separated by the hyphen character (<mentioned>-</mentioned>, U+002D).
      The tag is made of the following subtags, in the following order. Every subtag except the
      first is optional. If present, each occurs only once, except the fourth and fifth components
      (variant and extension), which are repeatable. <list type="gloss"><label>language</label><item>The IANA-registered code for the language. This is almost always the same as the ISO
          639 2-letter language code if there is one. The list of available registered language
          subtags can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"/>. It is recommended
          that this code be written in lower case.</item><label>script</label><item>The ISO 15924 code for the script. These codes consist of 4 letters, and it is
          recommended they be written with an initial capital, the other three letters in lower
          case. The canonical list of codes is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and is
          available at <ptr target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html"/>. The IETF
          recommends this code be omitted unless it is necessary to make a distinction you need.</item><label>region</label><item>Either an ISO 3166 country code or a UN M.49 region code that is registered with IANA
          (not all such codes are registered, e.g. UN codes for economic groupings or codes for
          countries for which there is already an ISO 3166 2-letter code are not registered). The
          former consist of 2 letters, and it is recommended they be written in upper case. The list
          of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/iso-3166-1_decoding_table.htm"/>. The latter consist of 3 digits; the list of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm"/>.</item><label>variant</label><item>An IANA-registered variation. These codes <quote rend="quoted">are used to indicate
            additional, well-recognized variations that define a language or its dialects that are
            not covered by other available subtags</quote>.</item><label>extension</label><item>An extension has the format of a single letter followed by a hyphen followed by
          additional subtags. These exist to allow for future extension to BCP 47, but as of this
          writing no such extensions are in use.</item><label>private use</label><item>An extension that uses the initial subtag of the single letter
          <mentioned>x</mentioned> (i.e., starts with <code>x-</code>) has no meaning except as
          negotiated among the parties involved. These should be used with great care, since they
          interfere with the interoperability that use of RFC 4646 is intended to promote. In order
          for a document that makes use of these subtags to be TEI-conformant, a corresponding
            <gi>language</gi> element must be present in the TEI header.</item></list>
      </p>
    <p>There are two exceptions to the above format. First, there are language tags in the <ref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">IANA registry</ref> that
      do not match the above syntax, but are present because they have been
      <soCalled>grandfathered</soCalled> from previous specifications.</p>
    <p>Second, an entire language tag can consist of only a private use subtag. These tags start
      with <code>x-</code>, and do not need to follow any further rules established by the IETF and
      endorsed by these Guidelines. Like all language tags that make use of private use subtags, the
      language in question must be documented in a corresponding <gi>language</gi> element in the
      TEI header.</p>
    <p>Examples include <list type="gloss"><label><val>sn</val></label><item>Shona</item><label><val>zh-TW</val></label><item>Taiwanese</item><label><val>zh-Hant-HK</val></label><item>Chinese written in traditional script as used in Hong Kong</item><label><val>en-SL</val></label><item>English as spoken in Sierra Leone</item><label><val>pl</val></label><item>Polish</item><label><val>es-MX</val></label><item>Spanish as spoken in Mexico</item><label><val>es-419</val></label><item>Spanish as spoken in Latin America</item></list>

    <p>In formal terminological work, there is frequently discussion over whether terms must be
      atomic or may include multi-word lexical items, symbolic designations, or phraseological
      units. The <gi>term</gi> element may be used to mark any of these. No position is taken on the

    <p>As with other members of the <ident type="class">att.canonical</ident> class, instances of
      this element occuring in a text may be associated with a canonical definition, either by means
      of a URI (using the <att>ref</att> attribute), or by means of some system-specific code value
      (using the <att>key</att> attribute). Because the mutually exclusive <att>target</att> and

    <p>This element should be used for deletion of shorter sequences of text, typically single words
      or phrases. The <gi>delSpan</gi> element should be used for longer sequences of text, for
      those containing structural subdivisions, and for those containing overlapping additions and
      deletions.</p>
    <p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible in order for the encoder to be able to
      transcribe it (unless it is restored in a <gi>supplied</gi> tag). Illegible or lost text within a 
      deletion may be marked using the <gi>gap</gi> tag to signal that text is present but has not
      been transcribed, or is no longer visible. Attributes on the <gi>gap</gi>
      element may be used to indicate how much text is omitted, the reason for omitting it, etc. If
      text is not fully legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element (available when using the additional
      tagset for transcription of primary sources) should be used to signal the areas of text which
      cannot be read with confidence in a similar way.</p>
    <p>Degrees of uncertainty over what can still be read, or whether a deletion was intended may be
      indicated by use of the <gi>certainty</gi> element (see <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CE.html#CE">21. Certainty, Precision, and Responsibility</ref>).</p>
    <p>There is a clear distinction in the TEI between <gi>del</gi>
    and <gi>surplus</gi> on the one hand and <gi>gap</gi> or
    <gi>unclear</gi> on the other. <gi>del</gi> indicates a
    deletion present in the source being transcribed, which states
     the author's or a later scribe's intent to cancel or remove
     text. <gi>surplus</gi> indicates material present in the source
     being transcribed which  should have been so
     deleted, but which is not in fact. <gi>gap</gi> or <gi>unclear</gi>, by contrast, signal an
     editor's or encoder's decision to omit something or their
     inability to read the source text.

        <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for the sake of those who wish to
                    classify abbreviations at their point of occurrence; this may be useful in some
                    circumstances, though usually the same abbreviation will have the same type in
                    all occurrences. As the sample values make clear, abbreviations may be
                    classified by the method used to construct them, the method of writing them, or
                    the referent of the term abbreviated; the typology used is up to the encoder and
                    should be carefully planned to meet the needs of the expected use. For a

            eightpence. <list rend="numbered"><item n="1.1">And if anyone does spare one, he is to pay for the thief with his

        <p>In this example, a <gi>place</gi> element containing information about the city of 
           London is linked with two <gi>person</gi> elements in a literary personography. 
           This correspondence represents a slightly looser relationship than the one in the 
           preceding example; there is no sense in which an allegorical character could be 
           substituted for the physical city, or vice versa, but there is obviously a correspondence 
           between them.

One use of the element is to mark text features for which no appropriate markup is otherwise defined. Another use is to provide an identifier for some segment which is to be pointed at by some other element—i.e. to provide a target, or a part of a target, for a <gi>ptr</gi> or other similar element.</p>

    <p>L'élément <gi>seg</gi> peut être utilisé à la discrétion de l'encodeur pour baliser tout segment du texte intéressant pour un traitement informatique. L'un des usages de cet élément est d'encoder des caractéristiques textuelles pour lesquelles aucun balisage approprié n'est défini par ailleurs. Un autre usage consiste à fournir un identifiant pour un segment vers lequel pointe un autre élément - c'est-à-dire à fournir une cible, ou une partie de cible, pour un élément <gi>ptr</gi> ou pour un autre élément similaire.</p>

    <p>Generally, each <gi>interp</gi> element carries an
    <att>xml:id</att> attribute. This permits the encoder to
    explicitly associate the interpretation represented by the content
    of an <gi>interp</gi> with any textual element through its
    <att>ana</att> attribute.</p>
    <p>Alternatively (or, in addition) an <gi>interp</gi> may carry an
