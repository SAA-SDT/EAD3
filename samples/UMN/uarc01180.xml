		<head>Scope and Content</head> 
		<p>The John W. Gibler Papers include a wide range of wheat and crop
		  breeding-related materials, including Gibler’s collection of journal articles,
		  conference papers, plant-crossing ledgers and other technical and
		  field-oriented materials. The materials cover the period when Gibler began his
		  work in Mexico with Norman Borlaug in the early 1950s through the mid 1990s,
		  when Gibler retired from consulting and international travel. The collection
		  also includes work-related and personal correspondence. Much of the collection
		  is in languages other than English. Because of the large volume, no attempt was
		  made to identify the language of materials at the folder level. </p> 
		<p>The material was in no discernable order. The collection has been
		  organized into six series: Series 1. Professional Affiliations, includes
		  documents generated by organizations and companies Gibler worked with or for
		  during the course of his career. Series 2. Correspondence is divided into two
		  sub-series, Personal and Professional. Series 3. Country Bulletins, contains
		  copies of the official publications from Central and South American
		  organizations Gibler was affiliated with. These materials are primarily in
		  Portuguese and Spanish. Series 4. Crop-Related Publications includes Gibler’s
		  library of crop-related research materials. Crops featured in this section
		  include wheat, triticale, soybeans, corn, oats and barley. The bulk of the
		  material focuses on wheat crosses and wheat pedigrees, and includes the
		  published crosses of wheat generated during Gibler's work in Mexico. Most
		  materials are in English, with some in Portuguese and French. Series 5. Awards
		  and Honorarium. Series 6. Miscellaneous, includes news clippings, photographs,
		  and biographical information. </p>

		<head>Biographical Sketch of John Gibler (1920-2006)</head> 
		<p>John Wesley Gibler, B.S. (1947) University of Montana; M.S. (1950),
		  Ph.D. (1951) University of Minnesota. University of Minnesota alumnus and
		  contemporary of Norman Borlaug. Expert in the breeding of cereal and soybeans
		  in highly toxic soils and leader in Latin American crop development. </p> 
		<p>John Gibler was born in Willow City, South Dakota on November 10,
		  1920. He grew up in rural Teton County, Montana where his father and mother
		  farmed. He served as a Navy pilot in WWII, and enrolled at the University of
		  Montana after leaving the service, earning his bachelor's degree in 1947.
		  Gibler then enrolled in the University of Minnesota, earning his M.S. in 1950
		  and Ph.D. in 1951, both in plant pathology. After receiving his doctorate,
		  Gibler was recommended by E.C. Stakman to join Norman Borlaug in Mexico to work
		  on wheat breeding projects. Gibler remained in Mexico through 1955. From 1955
		  through 1969, Gibler worked as an agricultural consultant for the Rockefeller
		  Foundation. He provided leadership on wheat, barley and oat improvement
		  programs in Colombia (1956-1965) and Ecuador (1965-1967). In 1968-1969, he
		  returned to Mexico and served as Director of Agricultural Programs at CIMMYT.
		  His twenty years in the field in South American solidified his expertise in
		  cereal and soybean breeding and seed production in highly toxic soils. </p> 
		<p>Between 1969 and 1980, Gibler held several positions simultaneously in
		  the public and private sector. He was Director of Massey-Ferguson International
		  Programs based in Brazil from 1969-1980. He also served as Technical Director
		  for FECOTRIGO (Federation of Farmer’s Wheat and Soybean Cooperatives of Rio
		  Grand e do Sul Brazil) from 1969-1977, and Research Director for OCEPAR
		  (Organization of Farm Cooperatives) in Brazil from 1977-1979. </p> 
		<p>Between 1955 and 1980, Gibler participated in numerous special
		  assignments which took him around the globe. He participated in crop
		  improvement feasibility studies in the Near East, North Africa, Turkey, Spain,
		  and Central American countries conducted by U.S. AID, FAO, the Rockefeller and
		  Ford Foundations, CENTO and the World Bank From 1980-1983, Gibler worked
		  briefly for International Plant Research Institute in the Cereals Program. When
		  that company failed, Gibler returned to consulting, and spent his remaining
		  work years through the mid 1990s advising South and Central American
		  agricultural ministries on crop programs, concentrating on Bolivia and Brazil.
		  </p> 
		<p>Gibler received numerous honors for his work on wheat and triticale
		  breeding, and was highly regarded as a program administrator. He was awarded
		  the University of Minnesota’s E.C. Stakman award in September 2006. He Married
		  twice; first to Catherine Marie Zander, who died in 2001, and to Bettie Rice.
		  The Giblers had three children; Mary, Jeanette and Paul. John Gibler died
		  December 13, 2006 in Hot Springs, AK. </p>
