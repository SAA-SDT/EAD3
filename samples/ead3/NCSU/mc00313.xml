Because of the organization's involvement in legal and legislative matters, a Legal Foundation for the North Carolina Farm Bureau was created in 1983. In 1987, a Political Action Committee was also added. Educational programs of the Farm Bureau include the R. Flake Shaw Memorial Scholarship Fund, the Institute for Future Agricultural Leaders, and "Agriculture in the Classroom." </p><p>During the height of the Great Depression, a group of North Carolina farmers traveled to Washington in order to seek a solution to their many economic problems. They became aware of a need for mass organization through which they could work together to solve some of their problems. After researching the farming organizations of the time, these farmers decided to create a North Carolina chapter of the American Farm Bureau. </p><p>On March 2, 1936, the first meeting of the North Carolina Farm Bureau was called to order by Chairman J. E. Winslow. Although this initial meeting was held in Greenville, North Carolina, the organization elected to establish its headquarters at 403 Evans Street in Greensboro. An original membership numbered slightly over 2,000 people and represented 24 counties in eastern North Carolina. At the time, membership dues were $2.00 per member. In July 1936, the North Carolina Farm Bureau held its first annual meeting in Raleigh on the campus of North Carolina State College. By the time of this meeting, membership had grown to 4,490 members from 30 counties.</p><p>Throughout the 1940s, membership in the North Carolina Farm Bureau continued to grow. By 1944, the organization had 30,000 members, thus fulfilling the quota set by the American Farm Bureau Federation. By the end of the decade, the North Carolina Farm Bureau led the South in membership statistics. Administrators also furthered participation by establishing a Women's Committee for the organization in 1942.</p><p>In 1953, the North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company was established. The initial offering was limited to casualty lines. However, by the next year, members could receive life and annuity insurance through Southern Farm Bureau Life. Later additions to the insurance programs authorized fire lines and crop insurance. Later in the 1950s, the Farm Bureau elected to move its headquarters to Raleigh, where they inhabited the former Raleigh Times building.</p><p>Under the guidance of President B.C. Mangum, in 1962, the North Carolina Farm Bureau pioneered the creation of a group purchase program that would soon be adopted by other Farm Bureau chapters across the country. Managed by the newly-formed North Carolina Farm Bureau Service Company, this program offered a variety of Safemark products, including tires and batteries, to Bureau members at a substantial discount.</p><p>The following year, the North Carolina Farm Bureau furthered its expansion with the establishment of the North Carolina Farm Bureau Marketing Association. Involved in a number of commodity programs since its inception, the association provided farmers with the opportunity to strengthen both their marketing and bargaining powers. The initial focus of this sector was the hog market, however, markets for dairy products, broiler hens, and a variety of fruits and vegetables have also enjoyed success as a result of this program.</p><p>The 1970s proved to be another decade of growth for the Farm Bureau. The organization outgrew its initial Raleigh headquarters, and in 1971, moved to its current location on Glenwood Avenue. Later construction in 1980 and 1992 would even further expand this location. By 1974, membership had expanded to over 100,000 members.</p><p>Because of the organization's great involvement in legal and legislative matters, a Legal Foundation for the North Carolina Farm Bureau was created in 1983. In 1987, a Political Action Committee was also added. Recently, the Farm Bureau has established several programs that serve the educational needs of young people interested in a career in agriculture. Since 1958, the Farm Bureau has provided financial assistance to agriculture students through the R. Flake Shaw Memorial Scholarship Fund. In 1984, the North Carolina Farm Bureau, in conjunction with North Carolina State University, launched the Institute for Future Agricultural Leaders, which offers high school students the opportunity to attend a summer seminar on the prospects of a career in agriculture. The organization also soon added an "Agriculture in the Classroom" program that integrates ag-related curriculum into traditional courses of study.</p></bioghist><prefercite><p>[Identification of Item], North Carolina Farm Bureau Records, MC 313, Special Collections Research Center, North Carolina State University Libraries, Raleigh, North Carolina.</p></prefercite><scopecontent><p>The bulk of these papers document the corporate activities of the North Carolina Farm Bureau between 1936 and 1999.

This series is divided into five main subseries, each of which represent the main division of the Farm Bureau. The first and largest of these is the North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation. Within this subseries, historical and biographical sketches of the organization and its leaders are provided. Also included is basic information regarding committees, membership statistics, and awards programs. The next subseries gives a basic overview of the creation and objectives of the North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company. Third, a chronological arrangement of County Participation in the TBA Program provides insight into the inner workings of the North Carolina Farm Bureau Service Company. The next subseries focuses on the North Carolina Farm Bureau Marketing Association. In this subseries, each of the marketing programs, which range from hog marketing to dairy marketing, are listed and foldered individually. Finally, a complete listing of the minutes and other corporate documents of the North Carolina Farm Bureau Women's Committee are provided in the last subseries.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation</unittitle></did><c><did><unittitle>Organizational History</unittitle></did><c><did><unittitle>General Information, Philosophy, and Structure</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">1</container></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Historical Narratives</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">2</container><dao href="http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/handle/1840.6/497/simple-search?query=mc00313" daotype="unknown"/></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Constitution and Bylaws</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">3</container><dao href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.6/572" daotype="unknown"/></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Inaugural Year (1936) Meeting Minutes</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">4</container><dao href="http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/handle/1840.6/497/simple-search?query=mc00313" daotype="unknown"/></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Expansion of Programs</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">5</container></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Newspaper Clippings</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">6</container></did></c><c><did><unittitle>Farm Bureau Buildings</unittitle><container localtype="box">9</container><container localtype="folder">7</container></did></c></c><c><did><unittitle>Administration</unittitle></did><c><did><unittitle>A.C.

For the North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, the primary document circulated through the organization was its annual policies. Arranged chronologically, these policies document the resolutions adopted by the Farm Bureau at its annual meetings. Often times, these policies also reflect and approve national resolutions proposed by the American Farm Bureau Federation. The Federation subseries also includes miscellaneous propaganda pamphlets circulated by the organization. The next subseries lists the General Manager's Reports for the North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company. Although the chronological list reveals several lapses, this subseries does contain all reports accessioned with the collection. Third, the printed materials circulated by the North Carolina Farm Bureau Service Company are dominated by price lists for Safemark products offered by the program. Finally, the subseries for the North Carolina Farm Bureau Women's Committee contains handbooks that reveal the goals and objectives of the group.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>North Carolina

The bulk of these records detail statistics from 1940-1970. Several original ledgers and bank registers of the organization are also included in this series. These ledgers have been split into four main subgroups: payments, disbursements, income, and receipts. In the case of many ledgers, the organization kept several records for a particular year, hence the overlapping dates for many of the ledgers.</p></scopecontent><c><did><unittitle>Membership Dues (By
