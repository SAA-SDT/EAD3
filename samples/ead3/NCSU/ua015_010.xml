After the college's Board of Trustees made the decision to grant the team requested funds in 1893, North Carolina A&amp;M played its first formal (non-scrimmage) intercollegiate game that fall against the University of North Carolina's football second team.  In 1921, NC State became a charter member of the Southern Intercollegiate Conference, remaining until 1953, when along with Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, Maryland, South Carolina, Wake Forest, and Clemson, the university withdrew to form the Atlantic Coast Conference.  In 1974, the first women's athletic teams began play. As of 2009, NC State had eleven men's and eleven women's varsity athletic teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The Media Relations office (formerly, Sports Information) has existed in some form at NC State since the 1940s, as a reference and records-keeping center for statistics and information relating to NC State Athletics.</abstract><physdescstructured physdescstructuredtype="spaceoccupied" coverage="whole"><quantity>233</quantity><unittype>linear feet</unittype></physdescstructured><physloc>For current information on the location of these materials, please consult the Special Collections Research Center Reference Staff.</physloc><repository><corpname><part>North Carolina State University Libraries, Special Collections Research Center</part></corpname></repository></did><acqinfo><p>Transferred from North Carolina State University, Athletics, Media Relations.</p></acqinfo><arrangement><p>The records of North Carolina State University, Athletics, Media Relations are arranged into the following series (28): News Releases, General Records, Baseball, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Men's Cross Country, Men's Fencing, Football, Men's Golf, Men's Gymnastics, Men's Lacrosse, Men's Rifle, Men's Soccer, Men's Swimming and Diving, Men's Tennis, Men's Track and Field, Wrestling, Women's Gymnastics, Softball, Women's Swimming and Diving, Women's Soccer, Women's Cross Country, Women's Tennis, Women's Track and Field, Women's Fencing, Women's Golf, Volleyball, and Cheerleading.

The following year it played its first formal games after the Board of Trustees granted it funds.  The baseball team first played in 1894, and men’s basketball in 1911.  In the early years the teams used various nicknames, including "Red Terrors." In 1921, the NC State football team began using the name "Wolfpack," and in 1947 this name was officially adopted for all athletic teams.  NC State became a charter member of the Southern Conference in 1921, but it left in 1953 to help form the Atlantic Coast Conference.  The racial integration of athletics began at NC State in 1958.  In 1974, the first women's athletic team (basketball) began play, and the following year women's softball and volleyball were introduced. </p><p>For more information on the history of particular sports, see the notes for each one listed on the "Contents" tab.</p></bioghist><prefercite><p>[Identification of item], North Carolina State University, Athletics, Media Relations Records, UA 015.010, Special Collections Research Center, North Carolina State University Libraries, Raleigh, NC</p></prefercite><processinfo><p>Processed by Cate Putirskis, 2009 June-Nov.

Beginning in 1902, the first annual NCSU-Wake Forest Easter Monday game was played, a tradition that continued until 1947.  With a record of 14-7, the baseball team claimed their first state championship in 1907.  Baseball games were first broadcast on WPTF radio station in 1929.  In 1946, the team won the Big Four Conference title, and Doak Field opened as the new baseball facility in 1966.  In 1968, under the leadership of head coach Sam Esposito, the baseball team won the Atlantic Coast Conferenc (ACC) title and finished third in the College World Series.  From 2003 through 2008, the Wolfpack went to the NCAA tournament every year, a school record for most consecutive trips to the tournament.  </abstract></did><scopecontent><p>This series contains records from the NC State Baseball teams, including clippings, media guides, score books, box scores, player statistics, press releases, rosters, schedules, correspondence, and other general information.

Basketball game was played in 1911 against Wake Forest, and was held in the old Pullen Hall auditorium.  In 1924, home games were moved from Raleigh Memorial Auditorium to the first on-campus facility: Thompson Gymnasium.  With a 13-6 record, the basketball team claimed their first Southern Conference championship in 1929.  Morris Johnson was NC State's first All-American in basketball in 1930.  Everett Case, the winningest coach in NC State basketball history, served as head coach from 1946 until 1965, and in 1950, Coach Case led the Wolfpack to its first Final Four.  In 1947, the Men's Basketball team played in a national tournament for the first time (the National Invitational Tournament), and placed third.  On December 2, 1949, the first game was played in Reynolds Coliseum (replacing Thompson Gymnasium as the on-campus location for basketball games), against Washington &amp; Lee.  In 1954, during the first season of Atlantic Coast Conference play, NC State wins the championship.  On January 19, 1956, NC State played their first televised basketball game.  David Thompson became the first African American to be named an All-American in any sport at NC State in 1973.  In 1974, the basketball team won their first NCAA championship under the leadership of Coach Norman Sloan.  From 1981 through 1990, Jim Valvano was the men’s basketball coach, and led the team to an NCAA championship in 1983.  On November 19, 1999, the team played thier first home game in the off-campus RBC Center.             </abstract></did><scopecontent><p>This series contains the records of the Men's Basketball teams, including statistics, box scores, clippings, score books, individual game files, programs, media guides, schedules, player rosters, photographs, and other publications and general information.

program began in 1974 and was the first women’s athletic team at State.  Kay Yow was named as head coach in 1975, a position she held until her death in 2009.  In 1976, player Susan Yow, Coach Yow’s younger sister, became the first woman All-American in any sport at State.  In the first season of Atlantic Coast Conference league play for Women's Basketball (1978), NC State won the championship.  The team played in their first NCAA Tournament game in 1982, and reached the Final Four for the first time in 1998.  Coach Kay Yow was inducted into the Woman’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, and led the U.S. Olympic Women’s Basketball Team to win gold medals in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.   </abstract></did><scopecontent><p>This series contains the records of the Women's Basketball teams, including statistics, box scores, clippings, score books, individual game files, programs, media guides, schedules, player rosters, photographs, and other publications and general information.

The 1895 team was the first to wear the now traditional red and white colored uniforms, a change from their original pink and blue uniforms.  The first on-campus football game was played in 1907 on the field that would later become Riddick Stadium.  In 1918, John Ripple becomes the first athlete at NC State to be named an All-American in any sport, and in 1978, Ted Brown becomes the first African American to be named an All-American in football.  The football team adopted the nickname “Wolfpack” in 1921, although all other sports continued to use the name “Red Terrors.”  In 1930, the first night game was played at Riddick Stadium, and ended in a 37-0 victory against High Point.  The team was invited to their first post-season bowl game in 1947, the January 1 Gator bowl against the University of Oklahoma.  On October 21 1950, the football team played their first televised game against Maryland.  The new Carter Stadium (renamed Carter-Finley Stadium in 1979) opened on October 8, 1966, and in 1967 that Marcus Martin became the first African American member of the football team.  In 1967, the team won their first bowl game (the Liberty Bowl) against Georgia with a score of 14-7.  The team won their first ACC championship in 1979.</abstract></did><scopecontent><p>This series contains records from the NC State Football teams, including clippings, media guides, game programs, game and player statistics, press releases, rosters, schedules, player questionnaires, depth charts, and other general information.
